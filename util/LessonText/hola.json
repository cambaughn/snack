  "text": "Okay amigo (that means friend),

  I’m excited for you to start on your Spanish journey! First, let’s start with the basics.

  Hola!
  Pretty simple, right? You probably already know this, but that’s how most Spanish speakers say hello.

  There are also a few greetings that are specific to the time of the day (like good morning in English), but we’ll get into those later. For the most part, hola will work great for you.

  Okay, now that we’ve engaged in a conversation, what’s next? What do people say in English? Pretty often we say something like how are you?, and it’s the same in Spanish!

  Como estas?

  This literally means how (como) are you (estas)?

  This brings us to an important thing to note when learning Spanish for an English-speaker: a lot of the grammar can be translated almost word for word and make sense, so feel free to go with what feels right! Trust yourself."
