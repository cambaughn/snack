  "hola": "\n Hola amigo, \n \n Let’s jump right into learning something useful. The first thing you’ll need to know in your Spanish journey is how to greet someone and say “hi!” Here’s what that conversation will probably look like: \n \n ¡Hola! \n \n ¡Hola! Como estas? \n \n Bien. ¿ Y tu? \n \n Muy bien. \n \n Pretty simple, right? Let’s go through it, with the English translation. \n \n ¡Hola! \n (Hello) \n \n ¡Hola! Como estas? \n (Hello! How are you?) \n \n Bien. ¿ Y tu? \n (I’m good. And you?) \n \n Muy bien. \n (I’m very good.) \n \n One cool thing to note here is that, for the most part, Spanish has a very similar sentence structure to English, so as you’re starting out, you can think of a sentence in English and then swap in the Spanish words. That makes things easier! \n \n All right, to finish this up, here’s a quick list of the key vocab to pay attention to (we’ll come back to the rest soon). See you in the next lesson! \n \n hola: hello \n como: how \n bien: good \n y: and \n muy: very",

  "about": "\n Our goal with Snack is to give you the tools you need to learn efficiently and effectively and communicate with native speakers. \n \n We’re going to break down complex grammatical concepts into small, digestible chunks that are easy to understand. A lot of textbooks and applications teach the most “proper” or “respectful” ways to speak a language, but don’t teach you how people really communicate. We’re fixing that. \n \n Studying is great, but the best thing you can do is start using the language right away. That’s a big emphasis for us: making sure you understand things each step of the way, so that you can use the language you’re learning to communicate with people (that’s the whole point of this, right?). \n \n You can say a surprising amount with just a little bit of grammar and some creative vocab, and we’ll show you how. \n \n Forget “fluency.” \n \n Fluency is myth, and if you focus on it, you’ll just be disappointed and demotivated (trust us, we’ve been there). We want to help you have satisfying and fulfilling experiences in your new language, every step of the way, so that you stay motivated to learn. \n \n Learning a language happens bit-by-bit. We’ll help you, but you’re the one doing all the hard work. Thanks for letting us taking this journey with you."
